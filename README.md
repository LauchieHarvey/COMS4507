# Crypto-Vis Guide

Hey! This is a quick getting started guide for our project.

### Install Git
Firstly you'll need to have git installed.
Git should come with the git bash terminal on windows.
If you don't have git installed download it from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads


### Install NodeJS
Secondly you'll need a modern version of Node. Node helps us manage packages so that we don't have to write all of our code from scratch.  
To check if you have node already installed run `node --version` in your git bash terminal. If you don't get a version number back then  
you'll need to install it. 

Node can be installed on this website: https://nodejs.org/en/download

### Clone this repo

Next we'll clone the repository so that you can run the website and edit the code.
Clone this repository inside git bash with the following command:
`git clone git@github.com:LauchieHarvey/COMS4507.git`

#### NOTE: You might need to configure SSH keys for github if you haven't already.
Use this link for help with configuring ssh keys: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

run `ls` and you should see a new directory that contains the website code.

The rest of the documentation you need to get the project running is autogenerated below.

#### Install dependencies
Finally before we run the website we need to install the necessary packages.
Run the following commmand: 
`npm install`  
from the same directory as this README file.


## Everything below is autogenerated documentation by Create React App...


### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
